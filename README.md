# Join Lines Context Aware

A language-agnostic, context-aware Join Lines command.

## Features

- Merge string literals - single or double quote, `+`, `.`, or nothing as concat operator
- Merges line and docblock comments (supports `//`, `#`, `*`, and `;`)
- Removes trailing commas and omits spaces when merging onto a line with an opening or closing brace (`[]`, `{}`, `()`, or `<>`)
